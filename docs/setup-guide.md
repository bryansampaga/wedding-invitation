ZERO-COST DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
==========================

STACK
-----
Frontend:
GitHub Pages - Free

Backend:
Supabase Free

Your PC does NOT have to stay on.

==================================================
PART 1 - CREATE SUPABASE PROJECT
==================================================

1. Create a free Supabase account.
2. Create a new project.
3. Save your database password somewhere safe.
4. Wait for the project to finish setting up.

==================================================
PART 2 - GET YOUR PROJECT DETAILS
==================================================

Inside Supabase, locate your project API settings.

Copy ONLY:
- Project URL
- Publishable / anon key

DO NOT use:
- service_role key
- secret key

Open assets/js/config.js.

Replace:

PASTE_YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE

and:

PASTE_YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE

with your real values.

==================================================
PART 3 - CREATE DATABASE
==================================================

Open:

Supabase > SQL Editor

Create a new query.

Paste EVERYTHING from:

database/supabase-setup.sql

Click Run.

This creates:

guests
guest_photos

It also creates the database-side maximum:
3 photos per guest.

==================================================
PART 4 - CREATE PHOTO STORAGE
==================================================

Open:

Supabase > Storage

Create a bucket called EXACTLY:

wedding-photos

Set it to:

PRIVATE

The SQL file already contains starter storage policies.

==================================================
PART 5 - TEST A GUEST
==================================================

Open:

Supabase > Table Editor > guests

Insert a row.

Example:

name:
Anna Santos

message:
We would love to celebrate our wedding with you.

active:
true

Leave generated fields alone.

After saving, copy Anna's invite_token.

Her website URL becomes:

https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPOSITORY/?invite=THE_TOKEN

==================================================
PART 6 - GITHUB PAGES
==================================================

1. Create a new GitHub repository.

Example:

wedding-invitation

2. Upload these website files into the repository.

3. Open:

Repository > Settings > Pages

4. Under Build and deployment choose:

Source:
Deploy from a branch

Branch:
main

Folder:
/ (root)

5. Save.

GitHub will give you an address such as:

https://yourusername.github.io/wedding-invitation/

==================================================
GUEST LINKS
==================================================

Each guest gets the same website but a different token.

Example:

Anna:
https://yourusername.github.io/wedding-invitation/?invite=abc123

Juan:
https://yourusername.github.io/wedding-invitation/?invite=xyz789

Each link automatically loads that guest's name.

==================================================
PHOTO LIMIT
==================================================

Every guest can upload:

MAXIMUM 3 PHOTOS

The website shows:

0 / 3 photos uploaded
1 / 3 photos uploaded
2 / 3 photos uploaded
3 / 3 photos uploaded · Gallery complete

The frontend blocks a fourth photo.

Supabase ALSO blocks a fourth database entry.

==================================================
IMPORTANT
==================================================

The current guest-token approach is appropriate for a small private event,
but it is not equivalent to authenticated user accounts.

Do not place confidential information on the guest records.

Never expose a Supabase service-role/secret key in GitHub.
Only the frontend publishable/anon key belongs in assets/js/config.js.
